# Implementation-of-SHA-256
SHA stands for secure hashing algorithm, a hash of a data is irreversible and unique, which means that if I produce a hash of a certain data multiple times with the same hashing algorithm the reaulting hash would be the same, and given the hash you cannot obtain the original data.
SHA-256 is a secure hash algorithm which uses multiple cryptographic hash functions to create highly protected hash values.
